# 3semflow1week3handin
Containing all code from all tasks completed this week.
All tasks should be done except for the non-mandatory javascript ones from day 3.
I had some problems with my sql on docker because of memory issues(docker). All links in the movie projects SHOULD return something, but sometimes it randomly gives memory issues. I tried to fix it but i haven't been succesful yet.
Fetching is not done since we have been told to wait until monday, which means there is also currently not any UI involved.
Have fun!
